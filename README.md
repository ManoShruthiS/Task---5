# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

This task focuses on implementing Decision Trees and Random Forests using Scikit-learn and visualizing the decision tree with Graphviz.

## Contents
- Task - 5.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook with code for training, evaluation, and visualization.
- heart.csv: Dataset used (Heart Disease Dataset).
- README.md: This file.

## Steps Implemented
1. Trained a Decision Tree Classifier and visualized it using Graphviz.
2. Controlled tree depth to address overfitting.
3. Trained and evaluated a Random Forest Classifier.
4. Compared accuracy and interpreted feature importances.
5. Evaluated models using cross-validation.

## Requirements
- Python >= 3.7
- scikit-learn
- pandas
- matplotlib
- graphviz
